		<h1> Leadership </h1>
		<p id="home"> My involvement in colligate athletics and the internship position I held with
		 the Iowa Sports Foundation has provided me with the opportunities to grow as a leader.
		   I now express myself as a leader and am willing to showcase my leadership skills.</p>

•	I was recently elected track and field co-captain for the 2015-2016 season.  
During the off-season I was responsible for coordinating workouts for the sprinters.  
I communicated with the entire team and designed the workouts that best fit the needs of 
the team.  I also demonstrated the ability to communicate with coaches to improve my role 
as a captain.  This included the need to focus on the growth of my teammates on a daily basis,
yet still enhancing my skills as an athlete at the same time.  An additional responsibility
was to coordinate meetings to assess team goals and how those goals would be met.  
Finally I demonstrated the ability to act as a role model for over 100 athletes and motivate
them to perform at their highest level possible. Pictured to the right are the captains 
for the men's and women's teams.  </p>

•	I also gained leadership experience during my internship with the Iowa Sports Foundation.
  During the summer of 2015, I assisted in the coordination of the Summer Iowa Games.  
  My duties included managing equipment and entering results from all 60 sports involved 
  in the games.  I was responsible for coordinating equipment packages that were specific 
  for each sport.  I communicated with the commissioners for each sport to ensure they had 
  the equipment they needed to effectively run the event.  I also managed the results from 
  each sport and entered them into the Iowa Games website.  I lead the interns in processing
   the information into the database of the company.
