			<h2>Iowa Sports Foundation</h2>
				<dt> Iowa Games Intern (Summer 2015) </dt>
				<dd>My previous experience involving athletics includes an internship with
				the Iowa Sports Foundation under the direction of CEO, Chuck Long in Ames, Iowa.  
				My main duties included communicating with directors of 60 sports and 
				organizing equipment for the entire Summer Iowa Games.  I demonstrated 
				the ability to inform directors and participants of details regarding 
				the events as well as resolved any issues customers had with sign-up or 
				payment methods.  I was also a member of the Iowa Games promotional team 
				and recruited the people of Iowa to participate in the games.  Throughout
				the games I learned a lot about youth activities and recreation.  This 
				opportunity allowed me to demonstrate my organization skills as well 
				as enhance my communication skills with customers. </dd>

			<h2> Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum </h2>
				<dt> Development Intern (Summer 2014) </dt>
				<dd> My main project for the museum was to develop content for a new 
				planned giving brochure.  I spent time researching many different non-profits
				to collect ideas to generate the overall content.  I learned many different 
				techniques non-profits use in their development programs.  Throughout the summer 
				I displayed the abilities to be self-sufficient and rely on my research of
				the museum and other organizations to create the most effective content for
				the brochure.  Below is the final draft I presented to my boss for the brochure.</dd>
