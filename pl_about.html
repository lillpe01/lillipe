		<h1> Hobbies </h1>
		<p>Most of my hobbies include me being active and enjoying the outdoors.  I love to 
		watch several sports my favorites being football and baseball.  I also enjoy exercising
		very much.  I love to road bike around my hometown.  My goal for the next year is to
		complete a triathlon.  A few of my favorite sports to play are golf and downhill 
		skiing. <p>
		<p>Another love of mine is to travel.  I have been to nearly 30 states and have explored
		numerous national parks.  My brother and I have ventured on two 15-day road trips
		across the western United States visiting national parks.  My family and I also love to travel
		to Florida for vacations.  I have also studied abroad in Vietnam for a month while I was at 
		Luther College<p>

	<h1> About Me </h1>
		<p> I would describe myself as hardworking, organized, and a good time manager. 
		My field of study at Luther College is management and I am interested in the 
		sports industry. I enjoy being a part of sporting events and like to learn about
		what happens behind the scenes of sporting events.  My previous job experience 
		has given me many skills with marketing and event management. </p>
		
		<p> I grew up in small town, Decorah, Iowa with my parents and one older brother. 
		Throughout my childhood, I participated in many sports and activities.  In high
		school I was a four-sport athlete as well as part of large group speech. <p id="underline"> During 
		this time I demonstrated the ability to manage my year-round athletic schedules while still
		maintaining a full course load.</p> </p>
	
		<p> I am most certainly not afraid of hard work either. For 4 summers I
		worked for Decorah Public Schools with the maintenance department.  Working 40 hours
		per week, my colleagues and I maintained the sports complexes and playgrounds on 
		the school's property.  I also preformed custodial duties within each building. <p>
