		<h2> About Peter Lillibridge </h2>
		<p> I am currently a senior at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa. I will receive my 
		Bachelor of Arts in May 2016 with an emphasis in business management.  During the
		2015-2016 school year I have served as a team captain on the Luther men's track and field
		team.  My work experience is particularly related to the sports and recreation industries
		and I have gain excellent experience in communication, leadership, and management.
		Upon graduating I hope to obtain a job within my interests and field of study.  
		I am truly passionate about sports and recreation and believe that athletics can
		 bring joy to many people.
